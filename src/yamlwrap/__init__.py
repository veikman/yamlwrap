"""yamlwrap functions.

This module could be expanded with customizations of the yaml/pyaml modules
to work around the fact that they avoid the desired '|' (literal) style for
scalars (strings) with words longer than a suitable line length. This is
particularly a problem when raw text records contain long URLs.
