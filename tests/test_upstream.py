    Advanced case, with a newline.

    pyaml should take care of this automatically, whereas PyYAML will not
    do so by default.

    Historically, there have been several problems with this:

    The Debian 9 and 10 editions of PyYAML 3.13 came with libyaml, a C back
    end that behaved as expected by this test. However, installed from PyPI
    without libyaml, 3.13 failed this test, implying some problem in the
    libyaml-agnostic pyaml‚Äôs use of PyYAML‚Äôs internals or a bug in PyYAML.
    PyYAML v4 added extended Unicode support which seems to solve the
    problem even in the PyPI version, though as of 2019-01, v4 is not yet
    released.
