        Historically, there have been several problems with this:

        The Debian 9 and 10 editions of PyYAML 3.13 came with libyaml, a C back
        end that behaved as expected by this test. However, installed from PyPI
        without libyaml, 3.13 failed this test, implying some problem in the
        libyaml-agnostic pyaml‚Äôs use of PyYAML‚Äôs internals or a bug in PyYAML.
        PyYAML v4 added extended Unicode support which seems to solve the
        problem even in the PyPI version, though as of 2019-01, v4 is not yet
        released.
